To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

``````html
for sections :
<section class="Instructions">
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol class="Instructions-list">
    <li>
      <span> Beat the eggs:</span>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt
      and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or
      milk for a fluffier texture.
    </li>
  </ol>
</section>
`````css using varibles: :root { --colorForTitles: hsl(30, 18%, 87%);
--fontOutfit: 'Outfit'; --fontYoung: 'Young Serif'; --colorForText: hsl(24, 5%,
